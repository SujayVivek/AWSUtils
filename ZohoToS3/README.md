## Please go through this:

1. Convert .xlsx and save it as input.csv
2. Run cleaner.js to clean the csv (You can refer to both csvs to get an idea)
3. Set .env variables

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=
LOCALPREFIX=F:\\04-12-2025 (example case)
AWS_REGION=

4. Run UploadLocalToS3.js
Works!
